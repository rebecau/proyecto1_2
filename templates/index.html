                  <td>To achieve ambitious 21st-century goals and deal with high-level complexity, a bio-based economy is required to cross the boundaries of a single sector and integrate tools, language and knowledge drawn from different disciplines and sub-disciplines. The present contribution highlights how life scientists, social scientists, policymakers and industrial stakeholders should work together to make this technological reversal real and feasible. Importantly, going beyond theoretical and methodological integration, the paper underlines the necessity of developing a new and more flexible educational framework that might facilitate interdisciplinary combination. Specifically, the experience of the summer school “Towards a bio-based economy: science, innovation, economics, education” organized by the University of Milano Bicocca in collaboration with Chalmers University is described. The results reveal the need for high-level education programs likely to promote and guide society towards bio-based innovation.</td>

While most authors have investigated positive adoption decisions, this paper focuses instead on consumer resistance to innovation. The current study presents a conceptual framework which explicates the major components of consumer resistance: (1) rejection, (2) postponement, and (3) opposition, and discusses two main groups of antecedents to consumer resistance: (1) degree of change required and (2) conflicts with the consumer’s prior belief structure. This framework is explored with both a literature review and a qualitative focus group study. These joint efforts result in the formulation of a model of consumer resistance. Finally, the authors discuss several relevant theoretical and strategic implications, and point out directions for future research.</td>

Drawing upon the Social Amplification of Risk Framework, this analysis empirically examines the impact of “climategate”—an international scandal resulting from the unauthorized release of emails between climate scientists in England and United States. The results demonstrate that “climategate” had a significant effect on public beliefs in global warming and trust in scientists. The loss of trust in scientists, however, was primarily among individuals with a strongly individualistic worldview or politically conservative ideology. Nonetheless, Americans overall continued to trust scientists more than other sources of information about global warming. Several other explanations for the declines in public understanding are also explored, including the poor state of the economy, a new administration and Congress, diminishing media attention, and abnormal winter weather.</td>

It is found that people in affluent societies have lower support for science than those in less affluent societies. Specifically, individuals holding post-materialist attitudes and living in countries with greater human and economic development (measured by higher internet access and tertiary enrollment, and lower infant mortality) have lower confidence in future-oriented science. The article concludes that the scientific gains that are brought by affluence are accompanied by heightened fears of human-made risks.</td>

                  <td>This paper distinguishes among contextualizing, conceptualizing, and problem?centring as three basic approaches to interdisciplinary curriculum. This typology is based on the type of inquiry that takes place in the classroom. For example, if the guiding epistemology in the interdisciplinary work is that of the humanities, the mode of connecting disciplinary material is likely to be contextualizing, or embedding the facts and ideas in the cultural, historical, or ideological fabric. If the scientific method guides and sets the standard for integration, conceptualizing work typically takes place. Finally, if the spirit and mode of inquiry is that of the applied sciences or creative product?development, the integrative process will take the form of problem?based investigation of urgent or tangible issues. Using empirical data from exemplary university, pre?university, and professional programmes in the US, I describe three integrative strategies and comment on their strengths. This basic typology provides alternative approaches to interdisciplinary material based on the purpose of the class inquiry. In the hands of a good instructor, several interdisciplinary strategies could be used together for mutual benefit.</td>

                  <td>More than 50 countries and international organisations worldwide are currently working on strategies and policies to promote a transition to a bioeconomy. This economic system centres on a sustainable use of bio- and renewable resources to guarantee sustainability. Although many contributions have been made to the field of bioeconomy, most focus on a science perspective (e.g. chemistry, engineering, technology, biomedicine or biology). Despite the significant importance of social and economic issues for a bioeconomy transition, studies from a social science perspective are largely lacking. This paper presents a systematic review of academic contributions to the field of bioeconomy from a social science standpoint. The results reveal the need for an in-depth analysis of the challenges and opportunities that the bioeconomy faces in social and economic terms.</td>

Therefore, there is the need to synthesize data reported by the extensive collection of studies to inform stakeholders on the right pathways for development, critical understanding, and optimization purposes. A meta-analysis was conducted to assess the efficiency of three main extraction processes under two performance indicators of efficiency -protein purity and protein recovery with data points from 41 published studies. The meta-analysis showed that processing conditions affect purity and recovery levels. Several investigations are still to be conducted to understand critical aspects of the pulse extraction processes. Challenges and hotspots requiring further research for a better understanding of some aspects of the extraction process are also presented.</td>

The model also examines the mediating effects of perceived benefit/risk on the relationships between explanatory variables with general acceptance, to better comprehend consumers' psychological mechanism behind acceptance. Based on a survey of 1582 respondents, our study offers robust evidence that pleasure, anxiety, and subjective knowledge are surely the key factors in influencing consumers’ acceptance of FAVs. In addition, our findings reveal a significant mediation. Specifically, compared to perceived risk, perceived benefit manifested a greater mediation on the pleasure–general acceptance as well as subjective knowledge-general acceptance relationship. It is also emphasized that practitioners should improve emotional design and publicity strategies to improve users' perception of FAV benefits and thus improve acceptance.</td>

                  <td>The German government is promoting the transition into a sustainable bioeconomy. While the discussions in politics and industry mainly focus on developing bio-based innovations, the role of citizens in this transition has received little attention. However, it is crucial to the transition process. The study explores how citizens perceive the transition process toward a bioeconomy and which factors influence their perceptions in the specific context of the phasing out of lignite mining in the Rheinische Revier. The Rheinische Revier serves as a pilot region for a bioeconomy transition. We used projective techniques to conduct eight focus groups of six participants each. Using qualitative content analysis, we found that the bioeconomy concept triggers different contrasting reactions and trade-offs. The findings show that the perception of a bioeconomy transition depends on the specific technologies that will be implemented and on the way that these technologies are communicated to the general public. Implications are that successful information campaigns should not only highlight benefits but should also discuss the challenges and possible conflicts before they can be trusted by the citizens.</td>

                  <td>This paper investigates the COVID-19 outbreak, explains the policies adopted by governments, and examines the side effects of social distancing on the global economy and international finance. Causal loop diagrams are used to explain the interlinkages amongst the important variables and show the outbreak follows the pattern of a reinforcing loop. Governments strive to balance this loop by adopting a set of policies, of which social distancing has left a tremendous negative impact on the global economy. The side effects of this policy are highlighted in three categories: short-term, midterm, and long-term by explaining the reinforcing loops that require time to get stimulated. The short-term loops result in demand and supply shocks in any economy, and if this policy stays effective for a longer period, the midterm loops get activated, leading to corporate and government debt crises. When the pandemic duration extends, the long-term side effects appear with a deflationary recession and a banking crisis. The quickness of moving from one category to another in an economy depends on the financial strength of firms and their government. Finally, this paper anticipates some changes in future business caused by the pandemic, which can bring insights for managers.</td>

Important scholarship has demonstrated how racialized structures entrenched by colonialism and apartheid set the scene for the rapid unfolding of the AIDS pandemic, like other causes of ill-health before it. Of particular relevance is the legacy of circular male-migration, an institution that for much of the 20th century helped to propel the transmission of sexually transmitted infections among black South Africans denied permanent urban residence. But while the deep-rooted antecedents of AIDS have been noted, less attention has been given to more recent changes in the political economy of sex, including those resulting from the post-apartheid government's adoption of broadly neo-liberal policies. As an unintentional consequence, male migration and apartheid can be seen as almost inevitably resulting in AIDS, a view that can disconnect the pandemic from contemporary social and economic debates.</td>

                  <td>We explore whether financing constraints affected the ways in which small and medium-sized enterprises navigated through the economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. We draw on data from a novel source, the COVID-19 Impact Follow-up Surveys conducted in 19 countries by the World Bank Enterprise Analysis Unit as a follow-up to enterprise surveys conducted in these countries prior to the COVID-19 outbreak. We find that previous bank-lending credit constraints magnified the effects of the pandemic. More specifically, credit-rationed firms were more likely to experience greater liquidity and cash flow problems and more likely than unconstrained firms to be delinquent in meeting their obligations to financial institutions during the economic crisis. Furthermore, these firms were less likely to have access to bank funding as a principal source of financing to address pandemic-induced cash flow and liquidity problems during the COVID-19 outbreak. We further find that credit-constrained firms were more likely to use trade credit, delay payments to suppliers or employees, and rely on government grants to cope with pandemic-related liquidity and cash flow problems. We find little evidence that credit-rationed firms were more likely to raise equity capital during this economic crisis. Finally, we find that financing constraints were more likely to hamper firms’ ability to adjust business operations in response to exogenous shocks. This study contributes to the literature on the impact of credit constraints on firm behavior in times of crisis.</td>

Green finance polices, e.g. carbon pricing, tradable green certificate (TGC) and green credit, can provide low-cost finances and counteract the adverse effects of COVID-19 pandemic. In this work, the generation costs of offshore wind power before and after the COVID-19 pandemic in China are analyzed using the data of 97 offshore wind power projects implemented in the period of 2014–2020, and the effect of green finance policy on the generation cost and the project profitability are evaluated. The results show that the average levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of offshore wind power decreased from 0.86 CNY/kWh in 2014 to 0.72 CNY/kWh in 2019, while it increased to 0.79 CNY/kWh in 2020, i.e. 10.85% increase relative to that in 2019. With the average carbon price of 50 CNY/t CO2, the average TGC price of 170 CNY and the green-credit policy being introduced, the average LCOE decreases to 0.76 CNY/kWh, 0.67 CNY/kWh and 0.74 CNY/kWh respectively. The green finance policy mix is still necessary to support the offshore wind power investment during the Covid-19 pandemic.</td>

                  <td>In 2020, the world experienced several significant events, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the collapse of international crude oil prices. Both have a great impact on a sustainable economy. Taking China as an example, we use a computable general equilibrium model with multi-sectors and multi-households and consider six different scenarios to simulate and evaluate the aggregate impacts of the pandemic and crude oil prices. We divide the impact of the pandemic into the changes of factor input and the changes of consumer preference and find that the decline of factor input is the leading cause of the economic downturn. The sharp drop in crude oil prices has a significant negative impact on the low-carbon economy. Although the pandemic has led to a decline in global carbon emissions, it is only because of the economic downturn. The epidemic situation and the change of oil price have double impacts on the economy, especially the sustainable economy. Adjusting the price gap between fossil energy and renewable energy (e.g., more stringent carbon pricing) and appropriate tax cuts on residents may be effective ways to alleviate the impact, which should be one of the environmental policies in the post-COVID-19 era.</td>

By embedding financial actors and the credit market, and by endogenising investors’ expectations, EIRIN analyses the finance-economy feedbacks, providing an accurate assessment of risks and policy co-benefits. We quantify the impacts of compounding COVID-19 and hurricanes on GDP through time using a compound risk indicator. We find that procyclical lending and credit market constraints amplify the initial shocks by limiting firms’ recovery investments, thus mining the effectiveness of higher government spending. When COVID-19 and hurricanes compound, non-linear dynamics that amplify losses emerge, negatively affecting the economic recovery, banks’ financial stability and public debt sustainability.</td>

                  <td>Epidemic modeling in complex networks is a hot research topic in recent years. The spreading of a virus (such as SARS-CoV-2) in a community, spreading computer viruses in communication networks, or spreading gossip on a social network is the subject of epidemic modeling. The Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) is one of the most popular epidemic models. One crucial issue in epidemic modeling is the determination of the spreading ability of the nodes. Thus, for example, super spreaders can be detected in the early stages. However, the SIR is a stochastic model, and it needs heavy Monte-Carlo simulations. Hence, the researchers focused on combining several centrality measures to distinguish the spreading capabilities of nodes. In this study, we proposed a new method called Lexical Sorting Centrality (LSC), which combines multiple centrality measures. The LSC uses a sorting mechanism similar to lexical sorting to combine various centrality measures for ranking nodes. We conducted experiments on six datasets using SIR to evaluate the performance of LSC and compared LSC with degree centrality (DC), eigenvector centrality (EC), closeness centrality (CC), betweenness centrality (BC), and Gravitational Centrality (GC). Experimental results show that LSC distinguishes the spreading ability of nodes more accurately, more decisively, and faster.</td>

The unidentified infected population means the infected but not identified people. They are not yet hospitalized and still can spread the disease to the susceptible. To estimate the unidentified infected population, we find the optimal model parameters which best fit the confirmed case data in the least-squares sense. Here, we use the time series data of the confirmed cases in China reported by World Health Organization. In addition, we perform the practical identifiability analysis of the proposed model using the Monte Carlo simulation. The proposed model is simple but potentially useful in estimating the unidentified infected population to monitor the effectiveness of interventions and to prepare the quantity of protective masks or COVID-19 diagnostic kit to supply, hospital beds, medical staffs, and so on. Therefore, to control the spread of the infectious disease, it is essential to estimate the number of the unidentified infected population. The proposed SUC model can be used as a basic building block mathematical equation for estimating unidentified infected population.</td>

To test the model, we compare the outputs generated by a finite-element solver with measured data over the Italian region of Lombardy, which has been heavily impacted by this crisis between February and April 2020. Our results show a strong qualitative agreement between the simulated forecast of the spatio-temporal COVID-19 spread in Lombardy and epidemiological data collected at the municipality level. Additional simulations exploring alternative scenarios for the relaxation of lockdown restrictions suggest that reopening strategies should account for local population densities and the specific dynamics of the contagion. Thus, we argue that data-driven simulations of our model could ultimately inform health authorities to design effective pandemic-arresting measures and anticipate the geographical allocation of crucial medical resources.</td>

We sought to identify factors that influence the formation, quality, and duration of these relationships and to develop testable hypotheses for intervention strategies. Findings suggest several themes related to relationship formation with non-parental adults, including barriers (e.g., youth's fears of being hurt) and facilitators (e.g., patience from the adult). Distinct themes were also identified relating to the ongoing development and longevity of these relationships. Youth also described multiple types of support and positive contributions to their development. Proposed intervention strategies include systematic incorporation of important non-parental adults into transition planning, enhanced training and matching procedures within formal mentoring programs, assistance for youth to strengthen their interpersonal awareness and skills, and the targeting of specific periods of need when linking youth to sources of adult support. Recommended research includes the development, pilot-testing, and evaluation of proposed strategies.</td>

The paper analyses in-depth interviews with 16 Norwegian young adults aged 20–32 who were either students or in stable employment at the time, and thus considered to be doing well according to common indicators in studies of care leavers’ outcomes. Two kinds of relationships between the young adults and CWS were identified: those who thought that CWS had recognized their needs and provided services accordingly and those who had either not been offered support or had been offered inadequate support. Our analysis indicates that a positive relationship between young adults and their caseworker facilitates both agency on the part of the young adult and provision of flexible support according to their needs.

                  <td>Multi-dimensional social support is an important factor in any positive transition into young adulthood, and youth who are exiting foster care ideally receive comprehensive social support from a range of informal and formal sources. Yet the social networks of transition-age foster youth are likely influenced over time by child welfare involvement, which can weaken or disrupt natural support relationships, while introducing service-oriented relationships that are not intended to last into adulthood. To better understand the social support context of youth aging out of care, we can apply social network theory and methods to systematically identify their networks of supportive relationships and explore support provision as a network-based indicator. This paper presents a methodological approach to measure foster youth support networks, and describes these networks in terms of their capacity to provide support as a function of size, composition, and density, and in terms of actual support provision through identified relationships. Such a measurement approach should be systematic and reliable over time, and capture social support constructs relevant to practice with this population; preliminary inter-item and test–retest consistency findings are promising, and the method demonstrates construct and predictive validity in comparison with a measure of perceived availability of social support.</td>

Given recent evidence suggesting that remaining in care may be beneficial, there is a need to understand why youth leave. Using data gathered from in-depth interviews with young people aging out of care, this paper explores this question, relating it to youths' understandings of adulthood and the successes and challenges they face during their transitions. We find that youth leave care because of misunderstanding and misinformation about the requirements for remaining in care, as well as because of a desire for autonomy and independence. Specifically, many youth equated adulthood with independence, and thus felt that they needed to leave care to achieve adulthood. Unfortunately, these efforts to be independent often hinder youths' development of supportive relationships, which they reported to be one of the greatest challenges in their transitions. Based on these findings, we conclude by challenging the conflation of adulthood and independence, as well as of childhood and dependence, calling for connected autonomy as a goal for child welfare involved young people of all ages.</td>

                  <td>This exploratory study is the first to investigate the attitudes and beliefs of older adolescents in foster care toward the implementation of a child welfare-based natural mentoring intervention designed to promote enduring, growth-fostering relationships between youth at risk of emancipation and caring, supportive nonparental adults from within the youth's existing social network. Six focus groups were conducted with 17 older youth in foster care attending a specialized charter high school for young people in out-of-home care in a large, urban city in the Northeast United States. Focus group data were transcribed and analyzed using a conventional content analysis approach. The following significant themes emerged related to natural mentoring for older foster youth emancipating from care: (1) need for permanent relationships with caring adults, (2) youth conceptions of natural mentoring, (3) unique challenges related to natural mentoring for youth in foster care, (4) role of a natural mentoring intervention in child welfare, and (5) challenges for implementing a child welfare-based natural mentoring intervention. Overall, our findings suggest that these young people are cautiously optimistic about the potential of a child welfare-based natural mentoring intervention to promote their social and emotional wellbeing. Future studies are needed to better understand the experiences of older foster youth with an actual natural mentoring intervention, including challenges, opportunities, and outcomes.</td>

                  <td>During emerging adulthood, most youth receive family support to help them weather the difficulties associated with transitioning to independence. When foster youth emancipate, they confront the challenges associated with emerging adulthood, and are at risk of having to transition without family support. Many are in danger of failing to meet minimal levels of self-sufficiency. A caring adult who offers social support is normative for adolescent development and protective for youth across many risk conditions. Natural mentoring can cultivate such relationships. This study examines the association between natural mentor relationship characteristics, and material hardship and asset-related outcomes during the emerging adulthood period in both a normative sample of young adults and young adults identified as former foster youth. This study also considers the potential mediating effect of future expectations. Data from Wave 3 of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health that pertain to 15,197 respondents are used. Path models with categorical dependent variables were estimated using a maximum likelihood method with standard errors that are robust to non-normality and non-independence of observations. “Like a parent”, “role model”, and “guidance/advice” were significantly associated with assets among both groups. This study contributes to the growing body of literature on natural mentoring and former foster youth, and highlights the value of increasing our understanding of natural mentor roles for intervention development. The focus on asset-related outcomes is a novel approach to investigate the benefits of natural mentoring to the healthy development of youth. This paper is the first to consider the association between natural mentoring and asset building among both former and nonformer foster youth.</td>

                  <td>While voxelization techniques are quite common in domains like medical imaging and computer games, they still have a lot of untapped potential when applied to CAD-models. As a discretized 3D representation, they have a significant potential for new approaches in the fields of knowledge management, workpiece classification and subsequently process planning – especially when enriched with Product Manufacturing Information (PMI). We developed a voxelization tool for colored 3D-mesh representations of workpiece geometries that allows for the structured, dimensionality-reducing storage of geometry information and PMI. The tool creates voxel-representations of triangular mesh representations by recursively splitting the space in which a mesh representation resides into eight equal cubes and checking for intersections with the mesh. If such a cube intersects with the mesh, it is again split. This process continues until a threshold cube size or recursion depth is reached. After termination, the voxelized 3D model is represented by the subset of resulting cubes containing exactly the cubes intersecting with the model’s surface. Additional functionalities have been implemented to accommodate data-centric use cases; that is, for watertight, closed meshes the tool discriminates inside and outside voxels and can include them accordingly. The calculated voxelization can also be arbitrarily sampled to a fixed voxel count – allowing to represent the 3D model by a vector of fixed length. This, for example, enables the application of AI/Machine Learning methods, the training of which typically requires a large amount of input vectors of a fixed length. Finally, we developed a plugin for the CAD application software Rhinoceros© that uses its 3D-canvas to display calculated voxelizations for visualization purposes. Going forward, data-centric applications can use workpiece information encoded inside the voxelization representation for a multitude of purposes such as similarity search or clustering.</td>

This means, many different applications, tools and corresponding data formats and standards are required to be integrated in a dynamic way, creating challenging data integration problems. The pervasive availability of relevant product information throughout the lifecycle for all stakeholders is required for the realisation of an efficient closed-loop PLM. Consequently, interoperability between the different IT systems is key to closed-loop PLM. Current interoperability approaches have several drawbacks in this regard.

Typical enterprise application integration solutions propose dedicated tools which allow the coupling between engineering software by mapping data representation from one tool to another.

                  <td>Developing intelligent systems to integrate numerous, autonomous and heterogeneous data sources in order to give end users an uniform query interface is a great challenging issue. The process of constructing a global schema of the integrated system is usually done manually. This is due to the presence of semantic and schematic heterogeneities among schemas of sources. In most cases, sources do not contain enough knowledge to help in solving these heterogeneities and then generating the global schema. In this paper, we present an ontology-driven integration approach called a priori approach. Its originality is that each data source participating in the integration process contains an ontology that defines the meaning of its own data. This approach ensures the automation of the integration process when all sources reference a shared ontology, and possibly extend it by adding their own concept specializations. We present two integration algorithms where (1) the shared ontology may be extended during the integration process, and (2) the instances of local sources are projected onto the shared ontology. Finally, we show that this theory allows to integrate automatically electronic catalogues into corporate engineering databases using the PLIB ontology model.</td>

A multi-region input-output analysis at national and sectoral analysis levels from the years 1995 to 2009 is conducted. The evolution and position of China's virtual water trade across a global supply chain are explored through cluster analysis. The results show that China represented 11.2% of the global water footprint in 1995 and 13.6% in 2009. The green virtual water is the largest of China's exports and imports. In general, China is a net exporter of virtual water during this time period. China mainly imports virtual water from the USA, India and Brazil, and mainly exports virtual water to the USA, Japan and Germany. The agriculture sector and the food sector represent the sectors with both the largest import and export virtual water quantities. China's global virtual water trade network has been relatively stable from 1995 to 2009. China has especially close relationships with the USA, Indonesia, India, Canada, Mexico, Brazil and Australia. Trade relations, resource endowment and supply-demand relationships may play key roles in China's global virtual water footprint network rather than geographical location. Finally, policy implications are proposed for China's long term sustainable water management and for global supply chain management in general.</td>

Based on input-output techniques, we simulate three scenarios aiming at saving 19% of the water available, a figure set by the first of them based on improving the efficiency of the current irrigation system. The same savings could also be reached by a twenty-seven-fold increase in the price of water or a 19.5% reduction in crop exports. Estimates indicate that the least costly solution is a more efficient irrigation system while export reduction is the second-best choice.</td>

                  <td>This study investigates the virtual water profile of the world in 2004 based on a multi-region input–output model. The water footprints of 112 nation-level regions are calculated and the footprint compositions of major water consumers are analyzed. Less than 35% of the global virtual water requirement is provided by agricultural products, in spite of the fact that 69% of the total water withdrawal is associated with agricultural sector. At the national scale, India, the United States, and mainland China are the world's largest virtual water consumers. Per capita water footprint varies from 30 m3 for Rest of South Central Africa to 3290 m3 for Luxembourg. As one of the major determinants of national footprint, international virtual water trade sums up to 30% of the direct water withdrawal of the world. Meanwhile, results show that 57% of the international virtual water flows is embodied in non-food trade, confirming the importance to take not only food product but also non-food product into account when overall water budget is considered. Mainland China is the world's leading exporter and deficit receiver in terms of virtual water trade (204 Gm3 and 142 Gm3, respectively), in contrast to the United States as the leading importer (178 Gm3) and Japan as the leading surplus receiver (77 Gm3). Finally, the virtual water trade connections of China and the United States with their major trading partners are revealed via introducing the index of virtual water dependency. Results presented in this study are of essential implications for policy making regarding water using pattern adjustment and water security enhancement.</td>

The results indicated that there was considerable diversity in the water footprints of the various provinces. Provinces with larger populations and greater GDP had larger water footprints, and developed regions had higher proportions of external water footprints. From the perspective of final demand, local consumption was the main factor driving the water footprints of these provinces.

                  <td>Import virtual water is an effective way to alleviate water shortage. Since China is a country that suffers severely from the lack of water resources, it is badly needed to research in virtual water export and import in China's foreign trade. This paper conducted thorough research on these issues and lucubrated on the detailed destinations and origins of China’s virtual water export and import using the input-output model. Moreover, the factors that affect China’s virtual water trade have also been studied in this paper. The results indicated that: (1) from 2000 to 2012, the volume of virtual water export increased from 65.2 billion tons to 114.1 billion tons, and its import volume increased from 62.4 billion tons to 108.7 billion tons. China was a net exporter of virtual water; (2) the export of virtual water was mainly exported by sectors such as Textile &amp;Garment and Leather Products, General Machinery and Equipment Manufacturing Industry, the import of virtual water was mainly imported by Agriculture, Petrochemical industry; (3) China has net exported large amounts of virtual water to developed areas such as the US, the European Union, and Japan, and has net imported from emerging economies and resource-oriented regions such as Taiwan (China), ASEAN, Brazil, Korea, Australia and Russia. Based on these conclusions, this paper proposed that China’s foreign trade structure needed to be adjusted to relieve the water shortage by the following methods the first is appropriately lower the export proportion of products from sectors such as Food, Beverage &amp; Tobacco Products, Petrochemical Industry, which exported a large proportion of virtual water; the second is to enlarge the export proportion of products with low water consumption, such as service industry; the third is to make full use of the water saving effect of import.</td>

                  <td>The water footprint is a consumption-based indicator of water use, referring to the total volume of freshwater used directly and indirectly by a nation or a company, or in the provision of a product or service. Despite widespread enthusiasm for the development and use of water footprints, some concerns have been raised about the concept and its usefulness. A variety of methodologies have been developed for water footprinting which differ with respect to how they deal with different forms of water use. The result is water footprint estimates which vary dramatically, often creating confusion. Despite these methodological qualms, the concept has had notable success in raising awareness about water use in agricultural and industrial supply chains, by providing a previously unavailable and (seemingly) simple numerical indicator of water use. Nevertheless, and even though a range of uses have already been suggested for water footprinting, its policy value remains unclear. Unlike the carbon footprint which provides a universal measure of human impact on the atmosphere's limited absorptive capacity, the water footprint in its conventional form solely quantifies a single production input without any accounting of the impacts of use, which vary spatially and temporally. Following an extensive review of the literature related to water footprints, this paper critically examines the present uses of the concept, focusing on its current strengths, shortcomings and promising research avenues to advance it. © Author(s) 2014.</td>

We find that: firstly, the water footprint for each region changed significantly from 2002 to 2007. Specifically, in 2002 the water footprints for the central, eastern coastal, southwest, northwest, southern coastal, northeast, northern coastal and Beijing–Tianjin regions were decreasing one by one; however, in 2007 those for the central, southwest, eastern coastal, southern coastal, northern coastal, northeast, Beijing–Tianjin and northwest regions were decreasing one by one. Secondly, the direction of domestic trade for regional virtual water in 2002 was not consistent with that in 2007. In 2002 the regions which had net export of virtual water were the southern coastal, central, northwest and southwest, while in 2007 those were the northeast, Beijing–Tianjin and northwest regions. Thirdly, China's virtual water trade patterns were inconsistent with the virtual water trade strategy in 2002 or 2007. Some regions such as the Beijing–Tianjin region were short of water, but they had virtual water transferred out. Fourthly, the agricultural sector has the largest water footprint. These results imply that China needs to improve the water use efficiency and readjust the pattern of virtual water trade. Besides, optimizing the sectoral distribution and structure among the regions is an essential measure for China.</td>

Considering the virtual water content of its trade, Andalusia is a net exporter of water.

In order to provide appropriate water mitigation policies a regional study is completed. Under this circumstance, Liaoning Province, a typical heavy industrial province in north China is chosen as a case study region. The input–output analysis method is employed in order to evaluate the water footprint both from production and consumption perspectives. The results show that the total water footprint of Liaoning in 2007 was 7.30 billion m3, a 84.6% of internal water footprint and a 15.4% external water footprint. The water trade balance of Liaoning was 2.68 billion m3, indicating that Liaoning was a net water export region, although water shortages are becoming a more serious concern. The “Agriculture” and “Food and beverage production” sectors are found to have the highest water footprint, water intensity, water exports, and water trade balance. Based upon Liaoning realities policy implications and suggestions are made, including industrial and trade structure adjustment, application of water efficient technology and management measures, and appropriate capacity-building efforts. The methodology and findings may be useful for investigation of water footprints throughout various regions of the world.</td>

                  <td>With rapid economic development in China, water crisis is becoming serious and may impede future sustainable development. The uneven distribution of water resources further aggravates such a problem. Under such a circumstance, the concepts of water footprint and virtual water have been proposed in order to respond water scarcity problems. This paper focuses on studying provincial disparity of China's water footprints and inter-provincial virtual water trade flows by adopting inter-regional input–output (IRIO) method. The results show that fast developing areas with larger economic scales such as Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shandong, Zhejiang, Shanghai and Xinjiang had the largest water footprints. The most developed and water scarce areas such as Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin and Shandong intended to import virtual water, a rational choice for mitigating their water crisis. Xinjiang, Jiangsu, Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, Guangxi and Hunan, had the largest per GDP water intensities and were the main water import regions. Another key finding is that agriculture water footprint was the main part in water footprint composition and water export trade. On the basis of these findings, policy implications on agriculture geographical dispersion, consumption behavior changes, trade structure adjustment and water use efficiency improvement are further discussed.</td>

This paper studies the evolution of domestic water consumption as a consequence of increasing agricultural production, as well as the impact that the growing need for water had on the construction of infrastructure for irrigation. To that end, we examine the water consumed in the production of vegetable and animal goods for five different years: 1860, 1900, 1930, 1962 and 2010. From these results, a detailed analysis of the trends in water consumption and changes in compositional patterns is carried out. We determine to what extent the development of the agricultural sector conditioned the construction of new irrigation infrastructure. Finally, a Decomposition Analysis (DA) is applied to analytically identify and quantify the main explanatory factors behind that evolution, and to understand the increase in agricultural water consumption over the long term. Our findings show the large pressures on water resources exerted as a result of the expansion of the Spanish agricultural sector during the last 150 years.</td>

The objective the study is to understand the changes in the water footprint (WF) of production and consumption for possible futures by region and to elaborate the main drivers of this change. In addition, we assess virtual water flows between the regions of the world to show dependencies of regions on water resources in other regions under different possible futures. We constructed four scenarios, along two axes, representing two key dimensions of uncertainty: globalization versus regional selfsufficiency, and economy-driven development versus development driven by social and environmental objectives. The study shows how different drivers will change the level of water consumption and pollution globally in 2050. The presented scenarios can form a basis for a further assessment of how humanity can mitigate future freshwater scarcity. We showed with this study that reducing humanity's water footprint to sustainable levels is possible even with increasing populations, provided that consumption patterns change. This study can help to guide corrective policies at both national and international levels, and to set priorities for the years ahead in order to achieve sustainable and equitable use of the world's fresh water resources.</td>

                  <td>The Yellow River, the second longest river in China, is facing increasing water scarcity due to rising water consumption of a fast growing economy and an increasingly urbanized population with water-intensive consumption patterns. The Yellow River Basin (YRB) is divided into three regions: the upper, middle and lower reaches; each with very different characteristics in terms of water resources, economic structure and household income and consumption patterns. Virtual water has been recognised as a potentially useful concept for redistributing water from water-rich to water-poor regions. In this study, we develop a Multi-Regional Input–Output model (MRIO) to assess the regional virtual water flows between the three reaches of the basin and the rest of China distinguishing green and blue water, as well as rural and urban household water footprints. Results show that all three reaches are net virtual water exporter, i.e. production and consumption activities outside the basin also put pressure on the water resources in the YRB. The results suggest a reduction of the export of virtual blue water that could instead be used for producing higher value added but lower water-intensive goods. In particular, the lower reach as the most water scarce region in the basin should increase the import of water intensive goods, such as irrigated crops and processed food products, from other more water abundant regions such as the South of China. Thus, trading virtual water can help sustain the economic growth of the regions within the basin thus easing the pressure from water shortage. In addition, there is a huge gap between urban and rural household water footprints in the basin. The average urban household’s water footprint is more than double the water footprint of a rural household in the basin. This is due to the higher urban household consumption of water-intensive goods and services, such as processed food products, wearing apparel and footwear, hotel and catering services and electricity.</td>

It implies that the international fossil energy trade is a multilayer structure, and each layer is a complex system with numerous countries and complicated relations. In this paper, we build the international fossil energy trade multilayer network (ETMN), and study the evolutionary characteristics of networks during 2002–2013. The generalization of several important indicators, including degree distribution, community, stability of communities and the time-varying evolution of main countries’ importance were discussed. Our conclusions suggest that: Firstly, the ETMN and three energy-specific networks including coal, oil, and natural gas display the scale-free characteristic in un-weighted and weighted networks. However, it shows that even if a few countries have major trading partners, there are not always a few countries that play critical roles in trade intensity. Secondly, the natural gas network has the largest number of communities and stability compared with networks of coal and oil, and the volatility of stability lagged one year than the other two networks for the specific form of pipeline transportation. Thirdly, studying on the stability of networks shows that geopolitical environment is the most important influenced factor, but the status of renewable and new energy increases with its development obviously. Fourthly, the evolutionary characteristics of three major countries’ importance, including United States, China and Japan, are analyzed in detail. At last, some policy suggestions were pointed out according to the results.</td>

Although China is the largest water withdrawal economy in the world, 50% of its direct water withdrawal is embodied in Chinese imports and exports. Due to an increasing division of activities between different production units, economies such as Mainland China mainly import intermediate products for further processing and then export final goods to other economies. Overall, Mainland China is a net embodied water supplier not only in final consumption-based trade relations but also in intermediate production-based ones. China’s total per capita water use is much lower than the global average, but yet China exports embodied water through trade activities. Pakistan, Myanmar and India are China’s largest embodied water suppliers, and Hong Kong, the United States and Japan are its largest net recipients. The main water exporting sectors in Mainland China are Electrical and Machinery (Sector 9) and Textiles and Wearing Apparel (Sector 5) respectively, and the main importing sector is Agriculture (Sector 1) with imports coming mainly from Myanmar, Pakistan, the United States and North Korea. This analysis of China’s global embodied water transfers can inform policies to increase China’s water use efficiency and can be generated to build embodied water budgets for a systematic allocation of water resources on the globe especially from the production- and consumption-based perspectives.</td>

In this paper, we show that the client can be completely classical if the server is rational (i.e., economically motivated), following the “rational proofs” framework of Azar and Micali. More precisely, we consider the following protocol. The server first sends the client a message allegedly equal to the solution of the problem that the client wants to solve. The client then gives the server a monetary reward whose amount is calculated in classical probabilistic polynomial-time by using the server’s message as an input. The reward function is constructed in such a way that the expectation value of the reward (the expectation over the client’s probabilistic computing) is maximum when the server’s message is the correct solution to the problem. The rational server who wants to maximize his/her profit therefore has to send the correct solution to the client. © Rinton Press.</td>

                  <td>Quantum Computing is a new paradigm that enables several advances which are impossible using classical technology. With the rise of quantum computers, the software is also invited to change so that it can better fit this new computation way. However, although a lot of research is being conducted in the quantum computing field, it is still scarce studies about the differences of the software and software engineering in this new context. Therefore, this article presents a systematic mapping study to present a wide review on the particularities and characteristics of software that are developed for quantum computers. A total of 24 papers were selected using digital libraries with the objective of answering three research questions elaborated in the conduct of this research. © 2021, CC BY.</td>

                  <td>Nowadays, some developing countries are experiencing many problems regarding children with Autism Spectrum Disorder, including Indonesia. Autism Spectrum Disorder is a childhood-onset developmental disorder of the immature brain, which impairs social communication and social interactions in addition to persistent restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior or interests. Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder need special treatments, such as therapy by professional and certified therapists. However, there are limitations to the number of therapists and the therapists have difficulty using therapeutic tools that require extra preparation time, also there are only a few applications that help therapists to carry out the therapy for Autism Spectrum Disorder children, especially applications that are developed in Indonesian and have complete features. Therefore, in this study, we proposed Squizzy, which is an assistive technology application that specifically designed as educational software for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder and developed in a tablet environment. During the development of Squizzy, we implemented Scrum methodology that will be explained in detail later. Based on the evaluation and discussion that conducted, Squizzy received many positive feedbacks from users, such as it helps therapists and parents to ease their therapy sessions by reducing the inconvenience of the therapeutic tool. Moreover, Squizzy successfully covered the cognitive part of children’s therapy.</td>

We reviewed the literature reporting prevalence rates of Autistic-like Traits (ALTs) and ASD in populations with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or other psychotic disorder. A search of three large databases was conducted and from this seven studies met the criteria for inclusion. The point prevalence rates for ALTs ranged from 9.6% to 61%, whilst the prevalence rates for diagnosed ASD ranged from &lt;1% to 52% across outpatient and inpatient populations. This suggests that prevalence rates of ALTs and ASD in psychosis populations are much higher than in the general population. This has important implications regarding future research, and clinical implications in terms of ensuring that patients receive the most appropriate diagnosis and treatment.</td>

This article explores the potential of a new interactive technology, converting text to emotionally expressive speech, to improve emotion processing ability and attention to faces in adults with ASC. We demonstrate a method for generating a near-videorealistic avatar (XpressiveTalk), which can produce a video of a face uttering inputted text, in a large variety of emotional tones. We then demonstrate that general population adults can correctly recognize the emotions portrayed by XpressiveTalk. Adults with ASC are significantly less accurate than controls, but still above chance levels for inferring emotions from XpressiveTalk. Both groups are significantly more accurate when inferring sad emotions from XpressiveTalk compared to the original actress, and rate these expressions as significantly more preferred and realistic. The potential applications for XpressiveTalk as an assistive technology for adults with ASC is discussed.</td>

Compared to controls matched for age, IQ and visual–perceptual ability, we found a group of AS adults was impaired in their recognition of fearful and sad expressions and spent significantly less time fixating the eye region of all faces. For AS subjects, but not controls, the extent of the failure to fixate the eyes predicted the degree of impairment at recognising fearful expressions. In addition, poor fear recognition and reduced fixation of the eyes were independently associated with greater levels of social anxiety in AS individuals. These findings support the hypothesis that avoidance of emotionally arousing stimuli, such as eyes, contributes to social–perceptual impairment in AS. Furthermore, our findings are consistent with theories implicating amygdala-mediated over-arousal and anxiety in the development of these social–perceptual deficits.</td>

To evaluate these alternatives, we adopted a fine-grained analysis of facial expression processing in autism. Specifically, we used the ‘facial expression megamix’ paradigm [Young, A. W., Rowland, D., Calder, A. J, Etcoff, N. L., Seth, A., &amp; Perrett, D. I. (1997). Facial expression megamix: Tests of dimensional and category accounts of emotion recognition Cognition and Emotion, 14, 39–60] in which adults with autism and a typically developing comparison group performed a six alternative forced-choice response to morphs of all possible combinations of the six basic expressions identified by Ekman [Ekman, P. (1972). Universals and cultural differences in facial expressions of emotion. In J. K. Cole (Ed.), Nebraska symposium on motivation: vol. 1971, (pp. 207–283). Lincoln, Nebraska: University of Nebraska Press] (happiness, sadness, disgust, anger, fear and surprise). Clear differences were evident between the two groups, most obviously in the recognition of fear, but also in the recognition of disgust and happiness. A second experiment demonstrated that individuals with autism are able to discriminate between different emotional images and suggests that low-level perceptual difficulties do not underlie the difficulties with emotion recognition.</td>

                  <td>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition in which children show reduced attention to social aspects of the environment. However in adults with ASD, evidence for social attentional deficits is equivocal. One problem is that many paradigms present social information in an unrealistic, isolated way. This study presented adults and adolescents, with and without ASD, with a complex social scene alongside another, non-social scene, and measured eye-movements during a 3-s viewing period. Analyses first identified viewing time to different regions and then investigated some more complex issues. These were: the location of the very first fixation in a trial (indicating attentional priority); the effect of a task instruction on scan paths; the extent to which gaze-following was evident; and the degree to which participants’ scan paths were influenced by the low-level properties of a scene. Results indicate a superficially normal attentional preference for social information in adults with ASD. However, more sensitive measures show that ASD does entail social attention problems across the lifespan, supporting accounts of the disorder which emphasise lifelong neurodevelopmental atypicalities. These subtle abnormalities may be sufficient to produce serious difficulties in real-life scenarios.</td>

The program enabled participants to laterally maneuver the scenes behind a static window, the borders of which partially occluded the scenes. The gaze direction of the person in the scenes spontaneously cued attention of both groups in the direction of gaze, affecting judgments of preference (Experiment 1a) and causing memory biases (Experiment 1b). Experiment 2 showed that the gaze direction of a person cues visual search accurately to the exact location of gaze in both groups.

                  <td>Support Vector Machines (SVMs) have achieved very good performance on different learning problems. However, the success of SVMs depends on the adequate choice of the values of a number of parameters (e.g., the kernel and regularization parameters). In the current work, we propose the combination of meta-learning and search algorithms to deal with the problem of SVM parameter selection. In this combination, given a new problem to be solved, meta-learning is employed to recommend SVM parameter values based on parameter configurations that have been successfully adopted in previous similar problems. The parameter values returned by meta-learning are then used as initial search points by a search technique, which will further explore the parameter space. In this proposal, we envisioned that the initial solutions provided by meta-learning are located in good regions of the search space (i.e. they are closer to optimum solutions). Hence, the search algorithm would need to evaluate a lower number of candidate solutions when looking for an adequate solution. In this work, we investigate the combination of meta-learning with two search algorithms: Particle Swarm Optimization and Tabu Search. The implemented hybrid algorithms were used to select the values of two SVM parameters in the regression domain. These combinations were compared with the use of the search algorithms without meta-learning. The experimental results on a set of 40 regression problems showed that, on average, the proposed hybrid methods obtained lower error rates when compared to their components applied in isolation.</td>

The development of business models based on collaborative consumption has become possible, among others, thanks to the development of ICT tools and easy access to the internet. The paper focuses on examining users’ opinions on the technological aspect of the functioning of sharing platforms. The following research question was asked: Do concerns of using technological solutions discourage the use of collaborative platforms? The research method used in the paper was a survey addressed to current and potential users of such platforms in Szczecin, Poland. The survey covered 403 respondents. In order to present the results, descriptive statistics were used and the Technology Fear Index (TFI) was constructed - a management tool that informs about the size of respondents’ fear of technologies used by collaborative platforms. The results showed that there are concerns of using technology, although they cannot be considered a disincentive to the use of collaborative platforms. A solution that can minimize users’ concerns may be a wider inclusion of external trusted websites responsible for e.g. identity management and mobile payments. Reducing some of users’ concerns may also be ensured by the platform’s participation in a cross-community reputation system.</td>

                  <td>Electronic polling systems promise benefits to voters such as accessibility and convenience that enable them to cast their votes at any time, from any Internet-connected computing device anywhere in the world. However, unlike traditional paper-based voting systems, an e-polling system introduces several security risks such as privacy of vote, unlinkability of a voter, voter coercion, secrecy of partial election results, verifiability, and poll integrity. The authenticity of a voter is another security concern, i.e., a voter must be identified through an authentication mechanism that prevents voting of unauthorized voters or multiple voting from authorized voters. Another security concern is the manipulation of votes by an infected (e.g., virus, malware, and so on) voting device. Since the voters use their personal devices to cast votes in an unsupervised environment, a malware-hosted device could make unauthorized modifications to the voter's voting choices. Many e-voting systems have been proposed, however, to date, all these schemes either fail to provide all the required security properties or are not practically feasible on light-weight computing devices. In this paper, we present a secure and verifiable polling system, SeVEP, that employs well-known cryptographic primitives to provide vote and voter's privacy, and poll integrity, confirms the identity of voters through a multifactor authentication scheme, enables multiple voting within the allowed polling period, prevents double voting, and achieves verifiability and uncoercibility in the presence of untrusted voting device. The security, performance, and comparative analysis in terms of security properties and cryptographic costs show that SeVEP is secure, verifiable, and practical e-polling system. © 2019 IEEE.</td>

                  <td>Objective: The aim of the following study was to evaluate the impact of premature rupture of membranes (PROM) on neonatal outcome, particularly on the incidence of intrauterine infections (IUI). Material and Methods: The study included 428 newborns, born after PROM and hospitalized in the Department of Neonatology at Poznan University of Medical Sciences in 2006. The influence of selected variables on the development of IUI and other complications was analyzed. Results: IUI occurred in 124 newborns (29%). The odds ratio (OR) of IUI incidence increased with decreasing gestational age, birth weight and Apgar score, as well as with increasing duration of the time between PROM and birth, called the latency period. Logistic regression showed that IUI was significantly influenced by the latency period (OR=1.37; 95% CI: 1.10-1.71; p&lt;0.01), gestational age (OR=2.29; 95% CI: 1.59-3.30; p&lt;0.0001) and 5-minute Apgar score (OR=2.50; 95% CI: 1.57-3,98; p&lt;0.001). The incidence of other complications such as prematurity, respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, intraventricular hemorrhage, and anemia increased with the duration of the latency period. Compared to uninfected infants, the infected ones were characterized by lower birth weight, lower gestational age, lower Apgar score and poorer laboratory results. Conclusions: Among neonates born from pregnancies complicated with PROM, the incidence of IUI is significantly influenced by the latency period, gestational age and 5- minute Apgar score. The incidence of other complications increases with the duration of the latency period. Prematurity is an important contributor to morbidity in this group of neonates. © Polskie Towarzystwo Ginekologiczne.</td>

                  <td>The analysis of the transitions that a protein conformation can undergo is an important step towards achieving a thorough understanding of protein functions. In this context, learning informative and transferable low-dimensional representations of proteins conformations is of great importance for developing robust computational approaches that can model proteins dynamical systems. In this paper we perform an experimental evaluation of the ability of the latent space representations learned by a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) trained on trajectories of proteins belonging to a superfamily to characterize an unseen protein from the same superfamily. In our study, we compare the latent space encodings obtained using two representations for the protein conformations and evaluate the impact of the latent space dimensionality on the embeddings’ quality. The obtained results outline that the VAE’s latent space can capture structural information characterizing a certain protein superfamily and, consequently, generalize to a different testing protein from that superfamily.</td>

                  <td>Here we propose the reweighted autoencoded variational Bayes for enhanced sampling (RAVE) method, a new iterative scheme that uses the deep learning framework of variational autoencoders to enhance sampling in molecular simulations. RAVE involves iterations between molecular simulations and deep learning in order to produce an increasingly accurate probability distribution along a low-dimensional latent space that captures the key features of the molecular simulation trajectory. Using the Kullback-Leibler divergence between this latent space distribution and the distribution of various trial reaction coordinates sampled from the molecular simulation, RAVE determines an optimum, yet nonetheless physically interpretable, reaction coordinate and optimum probability distribution. Both then directly serve as the biasing protocol for a new biased simulation, which is once again fed into the deep learning module with appropriate weights accounting for the bias, the procedure continuing until estimates of desirable thermodynamic observables are converged. Unlike recent methods using deep learning for enhanced sampling purposes, RAVE stands out in that (a) it naturally produces a physically interpretable reaction coordinate, (b) is independent of existing enhanced sampling protocols to enhance the fluctuations along the latent space identified via deep learning, and (c) it provides the ability to easily filter out spurious solutions learned by the deep learning procedure. The usefulness and reliability of RAVE is demonstrated by applying it to model potentials of increasing complexity, including computation of the binding free energy profile for a hydrophobic ligand-substrate system in explicit water with dissociation time of more than 3 min, in computer time at least twenty times less than that needed for umbrella sampling or metadynamics. © 2018 Author(s).</td>

In this work, we illustrate how this nonlinear latent embedding can be used as a collective variable for enhanced sampling and present a simple modification that allows us to rapidly perform sampling in multiple related systems. We first demonstrate our method is able to describe the effects of force field changes in capped alanine dipeptide after learning about a model using AMBER99. We further provide a simple extension to variational dynamics encoders that allows the model to be trained in a more efficient manner on larger systems by encoding the outputs of a linear transformation using time-structure based independent component analysis (tICA). Using this technique, we show how such a model trained for one protein, the WW domain, can efficiently be transferred to perform enhanced sampling on a related mutant protein, the GTT mutation. This method shows promise for its ability to rapidly sample related systems using a single transferable collective variable, enabling us to probe the effects of variation in increasingly large systems of biophysical interest. © 2018 American Chemical Society.</td>

Packing modes of proteins also affect their evolvability, and poorly packed, disordered, and conformationally diverse proteins may exhibit high evolvability. This dynamic view of protein structure, function, and evolvability is extrapolated to describe hypothetical scenarios for the evolution of the early proteins and future research directions in the area of protein dynamism and evolution.</td>

                  <td>Background: The 2018 IFSO Survey focused on similarities and disparities in the number and types of surgical and endoluminal interventions among the IFSO chapters occurred in the last decade. Methods: All IFSO Societies were asked to fill in the IFSO survey form on how many and which surgical and endoluminal interventions have been performed in the 2018. A special section was added, asking about the existence of national guidelines for bariatric and metabolic surgery, national recommendations for preoperative gastroscopy, type of reimbursement for bariatric/metabolic surgery, including for patients with BMI &lt; 35 kg/m2. The trend analyses from 2008 to 2018 were also performed. Results: Fifty-seven/65 (87.7%) IFSO Societies submitted completed forms. The American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery did not fill the IFSO survey form but provided an official report on the performed interventions. The total number of surgical and endoluminal procedures performed in 2018 in the world was 696,191. Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) remained the most commonly performed bariatric procedure (N = 386,096; 55.4%). Among the total reported bariatric/metabolic interventions, 604,223 (86.8%) were primary surgical and 29,167 (4.2%) primary endoluminal operations; 62,801 (9%) were revisional procedures. Conclusions: There was only a slight increase (10.317 procedures) in the total number of the reported bariatric interventions compared to the last IFSO survey. SG continues to be the most commonly performed operation since 2014. The one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB), currently the third most performed procedure after SG and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), continues to rise in popularity worldwide. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.</td>

                  <td>Background: Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding have been popular alternatives to laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass due to their technical ease and lower complication rates. Comprehensive longitudinal data are necessary to guide selection of the appropriate bariatric procedures for individual patients. Methods: We used the Truven Heath Analytics MarketScan® database between 2000 and 2015 to identify patients undergoing bariatric surgery. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard regression analyses were performed to compare complication rates between laparoscopic gastric bypass and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, as well as between laparoscopic gastric bypass and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. Results: 256,830 individuals met search criteria. By 2015, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy was the most commonly performed bariatric procedure followed by laparoscopic gastric bypass and then laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. Overall, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding had fewer complications relative to laparoscopic gastric bypass with the exceptions of heartburn, gastritis, and portal vein thrombosis following sleeve gastrectomy and heartburn and dysphagia following adjustable gastric banding. Conclusion: Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is now the most commonly performed bariatric procedure in the USA. It is reassuring that its overall postoperative complication rates are lower relative to laparoscopic gastric bypass. © 2018, The Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract.</td>

                  <td>Background: Recent reports have shown that, although rare, findings of mucosal ulcers and perforations of the nasal septum in some cases may be associated with the use of topical nasal glucocorticosteroids (GCS). It can been speculated that, a reduction in septal mucosal blood flow causing ischemia may eventually induce septal perforations. Aim: To evaluate whether a single dose of a potent nasal GCS given in a clinically recommended dose may acutely reduce the mucosal blood flow on the nasal septum. Methods: Six healthy subjects received in a randomised double blind placebo controlled crossover procedure one dose of 64 ?g budesonide® aqueous nasal spray (Rhinocort aqua®, AstraZeneca R&amp;D, Lund, Sweden) and placebo. One dose was delivered into each nasal cavity by means of a pump spray. As a positive control 140 ?g of xylometazoline (Nezeril®, AstraZeneca R&amp;D, Lund, Sweden) was sprayed in the same way, but in an open fashion. A wash-out period of at least 3 days followed each session. Blood flow was measured on the nasal septum with laser Doppler flowmetry up to 20 min after administration. Results: Budesonide did not affect the nasal septal mucosal blood flow as compared to placebo, but xylometazoline reduced the septal mucosal blood flow by 60.9±7.1% measured from baseline values. Conclusion: A single dose of intranasal budesonide aqueous nasal spray has no acute effects on nasal septal mucosal blood flow.</td>

There is no study in the literature to address the damages of oxymetazoline on the end organ. Materials and methods: The study conducted on 2 groups of rat. Group 1 (n = 8): Control; and Group 2 (n = 8): Oxymetazoline. During 4 week, the control group was applied with 2 drops of saline water on each nasal cavity 3 times a day and the other group was applied with 2 drops of oxymetazoline HCl 3 times a day. At the end of experiment, samples from mandible, parotid and tails of the rats were taken in 10% formalin for histopathological investigations. Results: In histopathological experiments, when compared with the control group, the oxymetazoline group showed significant increase in many of the histopathological parameters (ischemic changes: P = 0.0001; congestion: P = 0.0006; arterial thrombosis: P = Ns; PNL accumulations: P = 0.001; necrosis: P = 0.0001; and ulceration: P = 0.014). The results of histopathologic tests on the samples taken from mandible and parotid gland, in comparison with the control group, showed no significant increase (focal inflammation: P = Ns; and lymphocyte aggregation: P = Ns). Conclusion: Due to the damage that the long-term use of nasal spray including oxymetazoline, it may cause injury on the end organ, which we revealed in our histopathological experiments. We believe that it’s essential for the physicians to provide information on the side effects of the medicine to their patients who use for a long term. © 2015, E-Century Publishing Corporation.

                  <td>Oxymetazoline (6-tert-butyl-3-(2-imidazolin-2-ylmethyl)-2,4-dimethylphenol) has been widely used as a nonprescription nasal vasoconstrictor for &gt;40 years; however, its metabolic pathway has not been investigated. This study describes the in vitro metabolism of oxymetazoline in human, rat, and rabbit liver postmitochondrial supernatant fraction from homogenized tissue (S9) fractions and their microsomes supplemented with NADPH. The metabolites of oxymetazoline identified by liquid chromatography (LC)/UV/tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), included M1 (monohydroxylation of the t-butyl group), M2 (oxidative dehydrogenation of the imidazoline to an imidazole moiety), M3 (monohydroxylation of M2), M4 (dihydroxylation of oxymetazoline), and M5 (dihydroxylation of M2). Screening with nine human expressed cytochromes P450 (P450s) identified CYP2C19 as the single P450 isoform catalyzing the formation of M1, M2, and M3. Glutathione conjugates of oxymetazoline (M6) and M2 (M7) were identified in the liver S9 fractions, indicating the capability of oxymetazoline to undergo bioactivation to reactive intermediate species. M6 and M7 were not detected in those liver S9 incubations without NADPH. Cysteine conjugates (M8 and M9) derived from glutathione conjugates and hydroxylated glutathione conjugates (M10 and M11) were also identified. The reactive intermediate of oxymetazoline was trapped with glutathione and N-acetyl cysteine and identified by LC/MS/MS. M6 was isolated and identified by one-dimensional or two-dimensional NMR as the glutathione conjugate of a p-quinone methide. We have shown the tendency of oxymetazoline to form p-quinone methide species via a bioactivation mechanism involving a CYP2C19-catalyzed two-electron oxidation. Nevertheless, we conclude that the formation of this reactive species might not be a safety concern for oxymetazoline nasal products because of the typical low-dose and brief dosage regimen limited to nasal delivery.

Methods - In a consecutive stroke registry since 1988, 22 patients had stroke associated with over-the-counter sympathomimetics. Sympathomimetic dosage and type, time interval until stroke onset, and neuroimaging findings are described, Results - Ten male and 12 female patients were included, Intracerebral hemorrhage occurred in 17 patients, subarachnoid hemorrhage in 4, and ischemic stroke in 1, Stroke was associated with PPA use in 16 patients (dose 75 to 675 mg), with pseudoephedrine in 4 (dose 60 to 300 mg), and with others administered by the nasal route in 2 (oxymetazoline and phenylephrine), Stroke occurred after a single dose in 17 patients and after daily use during several days in 5. The interval between drug exposure and clinical onset varied from 30 minutes to 24 hours, Stroke occurred after recommended doses of PPA (50 to 75 mg) in 32% and pseudoephedrine (60 mg) in 50% of patients, Eight patients had acute hypertension at stroke onset. Cerebral angiography was normal in 8 cases and showed diffuse vasospasm or beading in 10 patients. Conclusions - Stroke related to over-the-counter sympathomimetics was associated with acute hypertension and/or vasospasm or angiitis mechanisms, most related to the use of PPA; however, stroke also occurred with the use of other sympathomimetics, particularly pseudoephedrine. Although stroke complications occurred when doses were used that were higher than recommended doses, apparently there is also a stroke risk when these agents are taken properly.</td>

                  <td>Objective: The objective of this study is to systematically review the literature and examine the safety for the use of topical vasoconstrictors in endoscopic sinus surgery. Study Design: Systematic review clinical trials. Method: A systematic literature search was performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, and National Guideline Clearinghouse, and references in the selected articles. Results: The search criteria captured 42 manuscripts with relevant titles. A systematic review on the topical use of phenylephrine was found; however, no other systematic review, meta-analyses, or clinical guidelines were identified. Six randomized clinical trials or comparative studies, as well as multiple case reports and review articles were also identified. The literature supports the safety of oxymetazoline and epinephrine when used judiciously in carefully selected patients undergoing endoscopic sinonasal surgery; however, topical phenylephrine is not recommended because of its risk profile. Conclusion: In sinus or nasal surgery, topical vasoconstrictors should be used in a manner that minimizes the risk of cardiovascular morbidity. © 2011 The American Laryngological, Rhinological, and Otological Society, Inc.</td>

Oxymetazoline hydrochloride 0.05%, phenylephrine hydrochloride 0.25%, or cocaine 4% was applied to the nasal mucosa in a prospective, randomized, double-blind fashion. Heart rate and blood pressure changes were recorded 5 and 10 minutes after application of the study vasoconstrictor to each nostril. The surgeon’s subjective impressions of bleeding and visualization were recorded for each side of the nose, as were total blood loss and anesthesia time. Although all three vasoconstrictors were tolerated well by the children, there was a suggestion that heart rate decreased more at 5 minutes with phenylephrine than with oxymetazoline or cocaine (P=.08) and that blood pressure increased more at 10 minutes with phenylephrine than with oxymetazoline or cocaine (P=.1). No arrhythmias were noted. Subjective scoring for bleeding showed that children receiving oxymetazoline were less likely to receive scores of “more” bleeding than usual (3/38 vs. 10/34 for phenylephrine and 10/35 for cocaine, P&lt;.02). Subjective scoring for visualization showed that children receiving oxymetazoline were also less likely to receive scores of “worse” visualization than usual (3/38 vs. 12/38 for phenylephrine and 9/35 for cocaine, P&lt;.01). There was no difference in surgical bleeding or visualization between children receiving phenylephrine and children receiving cocaine. In our institution, 0.05% oxymetazoline is the preferred vasoconstrictor for FESS in children. © The American Laryngological, Rhinological and Otological Society, Inc.</td>

                  <td>Objective - ADP plays an important role in platelet aggregation by activating P2Y12 receptors. We assessed the hypothesis that P2Y 12 receptors are expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). Methods and Results - P2Y12 receptor mRNA was found to have a high expression among the P2 receptors in human VSMC, significantly higher than the other 2 ADP receptors (P2Y, and P2Y13, real-time polymerase chain reaction). Western blots gave a band of 50 kD, similar to that in platelets. To unmask a P2Y12 receptor-mediated vasoconstriction by simulating the in vivo situation, vessels were precontracted to a submaximal level. 2-MeSADP stimulated contractions in vessel segments from internal mammary artery (IM), IM branches and small veins (Emax=15±6% of 60mmol/L K + contraction, pEC50=5.6±0.6, Emax= 21±1%, pEC50=6.8±0.1, and Emax=48±9%, pEC50=6.6±0.4). The selective P2Y12 antagonist AR-C67085 blocked 2-MeSADP contractions. The contraction was not reduced in patients using clopidogrel, a drug inhibiting ADP-induced platelet aggregation by blocking the P2Y12 receptor. This may be explained by the high instability of the active clopidogrel metabolite that never reaches the systemic circulation. Conclusion - ADP acting on P2Y12 receptors not only is important for platelet activation but also stimulates vasoconstriction. Stable drugs with antagonistic effects on P2Y12 receptors, affecting both platelets and VSMC, could be of double therapeutic benefit in their prevention of both thrombosis and vasospasm.</td>

This paper provides several examples of utilising the visual arts, cinema, and popular culture for communication in different contexts, with discussion of how each relates to the ethical values of the system of radiological protection. In this way, we find inter-relationships between science, ethics, and experience. Experience improves understanding; empathy, or the awareness and feeling of another’s experience, can lead to similar understanding. Drawing on art and the broader human experience will help us improve our communication, promote transparency, and encourage empathy.

Improvements in the technical quality of imaging failed to address the problem of overdiagnosis in breast cancer screening and exacerbate the problem in thyroid cancer diagnosis. Drawing on Douglas and on Daston and Galison, I distinguish 3 dimensions of objectivity (accuracy, reliability, and precision) and demonstrate ways they may be at odds, as illustrated in the early detection of cancer. Guidelines for evaluating the efficacy of diagnostic imaging are insufficiently sensitive to this complexity. Improving imaging quality may raise epistemic issues, place disease definitions in question, and lead to overall harm or to changes in the distribution of harms and benefits among population subgroups.

While growth in applications proceeded rapidly, it was accompanied by significant harms to those involved and by inappropriate opportunistic application. This paper places the attempts to deal with the harms and inappropriate activities side by side with the positive developments. It attempts a narrative on the development of medical radiation protection over the 125-year period and places it in the context of a commentary on governance and ethics. The substance of the narrative is based on the recommendations of ICRP as they developed and altered over time. The governance commentary is based on assessing the independence of ICRP and its attention to medical exposures. In terms of ethics, the recommendations at each stage are reviewed in the light of values that are deemed appropriate to both medical ethics and radiation protection. The paper, while celebrating Röntgen-125, also hopefully provides a perspective for discussion as ICRP’s centenary in 2028 approaches. This is an important part of ensuring continued acceptance and confident use of X-Rays, and helps underwrite the possibility of further developments in the area</td>

                  <td>An international expert consultation was convened by the World Health Organization (WHO). The purpose of the meeting was to review the use of CT in examining asymptomatic people. This is often referred to as individual health assessment (IHA). IHA was identified as a global phenomenon unenthusiastically tolerated, and not actively promoted, structured, or regulated in most countries. This paper identifies the state of the art for IHA and some considerations in relation to its justification, in different regions of the world. The outcomes reached include the following: questions around terminology and culture of IHA practice; review of IHA in some countries, regions, and international bodies; dilemmas for participants in IHA; risk communication, education, and training for professions and public; the desirability of guidelines and clinical audit; social, ethical, public health, and resource considerations; and a framework for IHA and regulatory considerations. Three subcategories of examination for asymptomatic individuals were identified: formal screening programs; examinations for which the evidence base or risk profile is incomplete; and opportunistic examinations with little or no evidence or risk profile to suggest they have any merit. The latter challenges the justification principle of radiation protection. In addition, the issue of the costs, direct and indirect, associated with false positives and/or equivocal/incidental findings were highlighted. These and other considerations make it difficult to view some IHA as a bona fide medical activity. To allow it to be viewed as such requires that it be conducted within a robust clinical governance framework that includes regulatory dimensions. © 2016 The World Health Organization</td>

To study imaging practices for children with minor head injury and the level of awareness of radiologists of the current clinical decision rules for minor traumatic brain injury (TBI). Methods: A questionnaire consisting of 17 questions was distributed electronically to 472 ESPR members. The questionnaire covered demographic information, employment status, years of experience and the current practice setting of the participants, the number of CTs performed for pediatric head trauma, awareness of clinical decision rules and use of shielding, pediatric CT protocol and MRI. Results: The response rate was 18.4%. The majority of participants was aged over 50 years and was full-time consultants. Regarding decision rules, 73.8% of respondents cited the NICE head injury guidelines, and 79% reported that the decision to perform CT was agreed between specialists. Shielding was used by 58.3% and 67.4% applied a specific pediatric protocol. MRI was not used for pediatric head trauma by 70.6% of respondents, although always available in 68.6% of cases. The reported obstacles to MRI use were machine availability (42.7%), the long acquisition time (39%) and patients’ intolerance (18.3%), and less frequently the cost and the need for sedation. Conclusion: There is room for decreasing the use of CT for pediatric minor TBI. The use of shielding and application of pediatric CT protocols constitute areas for improvement. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.</td>

The studies included a total of 237 patients and 34 pediatric and adult anthropomorphic phantoms for whom the radiation dose was reported. Bismuth shielding was recommended in 88.89% of the studies based on the maintenance of appropriate image quality under shielding. Noise associated with Bi shielding was 7.5%, 263%, and 23.5% for the eye, thyroid, and breast, respectively. The fixed-effects pooled estimate of dose reduction was 34% (95% CI: 13–55; p &lt; 0.001) for the eye, 37% (95% CI 14–61; p &lt; 0.001) for the thyroid, and 36% (95% CI 36–55; p &lt; 0.001) for the breast.

                  <td>Cataracts are the leading cause of blindness and visual disability worldwide. Of the known contributing factors to this condition, ionising radiation is considered the primary concern in a radiological context given the particular radiosensitivity of the lens of the eye. In light of the substantially increased application of computed tomography in brain imaging, an investigation of the relevent literature is warranted to assess thresholds, lens radiation doses and dose reduction techniques in respect to the cataractogenic risk of such examinations. The value and very existence of a lens dose threshold is debatable given different considerations of radiation dose, latency, opacity classifications and historical sample populations, though ICRP guidelines suggest a threshold of 0.5 Gy. Documented CT-specific radiation doses to the eye following scans of the brain are highly variable between studies (2–130 mGy), primarily owing to discrepancies in scanning technique. These findings, when coupled with the relative ambiguity of known threshold values, present difficulties in assessing the overall risk of cataracts following serial CT examinations to the head. In the absence of definitive risk evaluations, a cautionary approach is advised. The implementation of gantry tilt along the supraorbital margin is recommended as standard practice on account of its highly effective radiation dose reduction outcomes. Organ-based tube modulation and reductions in tube current may also be considered beneficial. Bismuth eye shielding is only advised where gantry tilting is unachievable, and in such cases, ensure careful adherence to appropriate shield placement and infection control measures. © 2019 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists</td>

                  <td>Objectives To determine the efficacy of a 0.5-mm lead apron across the patient's abdomen in addition to standard operator protection for the reduction of scatter radiation on operator and patient radiation exposure Background Cardiac angiography using the radial access compared to the femoral approach is associated with reduced complication rate and improved patient comfort but has significantly increased radiation dose. Improvements in radiation protection are needed Methods We randomly assigned 332 patients undergoing coronary angiography to a group with pelvic lead shielding and a group with standard protection. In each procedure, eight digital dosimeters were used to measure operator radiation dose [under the lead apron, outside the thyroid shield, and at the left side of the head], patient dose at the level of the umbilicus [above and beneath the lead apron], and two on the acrylic shielding and one on the image receptor to measure scattered radiation Results Both groups were similar in BMI, procedures performed, and number of sequences. Usage of lead shielding statistically significantly reduced the radiation dose of the operator at all three sites measured: under lead apron [all in ?Sv]: 0.53±1.4 vs. 0.17±0.6, on thyroid collar 5.9±7.7 vs. 2.9±3.4, and left side of head 3.3±3.4 vs. 2.1±2.2, P&lt;0.001. However the radiation to the patient was doubled from 15.4±24.1 to 28.9±81.1, P=0.04 Conclusions The use of a pelvic lead shield during radial angiography reduced the operator radiation exposure at multiple measurement sites. However there was an increased exposure to the patient. This balance should be further investigated before the widespread adoption of this method. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</td>

                  <td>Patients with developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) generally undergo multiple x-ray examinations of both hip joints. During these examinations, the gonads are completely exposed to radiation, unless shielded. Although many types and sizes of gonad shields exist, they often do not provide adequate protection because of size and placement issues; additionally, these shields are frequently omitted for female patients. Our aim was to assess gonad protection during x-ray examination that is provided by gonad shields designed for individual female patients with DDH. We retrospectively retrieved data from the Picture Archiving and Communication System database; pelvic plain x-ray films from 766 females, 18 years old or younger, were included in our analysis. Based on x-ray measurements of the anterior superior iliac spine, we developed a system of gonad shield design that depended on the distance between anterior superior iliac spine markers. We custom-made shields and then examined shielding rates and shielding accuracy before and after these new shields became available. Standard (general-purpose) shields were used before our custom design project was implemented. The shielding rate and shielding accuracy were, respectively, 14.5% and 8.4% before the project was implemented and 72.7% and 32.2% after it was implemented. A shield that is more anatomically correct and available in several different sizes may increase the likelihood of gonad protection during pelvic x-ray examinations. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.</td>

At infrared frequencies (terahertz), the value for the dielectric constant is ?80 at room temperature, which is far smaller than the value of ?105 obtained at lower radio frequencies (kilohertz). This discrepancy implies the presence of a strong absorption at very low frequencies due to dipole relaxation. At room temperature, the characteristic relaxation times are fast (?500 nanoseconds) but increase dramatically at low temperature, suggesting that the large change in dielectric constant may be due to a relaxor-like dynamical slowing down of dipolar fluctuations in nanosize domains.</td>

The samples of the CCTO ceramic were studied by X-ray powder diffraction, infrared and Raman scattering spectroscopy. The infrared and Raman scattering spectroscopy confirm the formation of the CCTO phase as seen by X-ray diffraction analysis. For one experimental procedure one uses an organic binder in the process of shaping the samples. In the second procedure the samples were prepared without the presence of the organic phase. For the second situation, we had higher dielectric constant (?r=7370) with high loss (D=0.2) at 1 KHz. For the first procedure one has the lower dielectric constant (?r=1530 and lower loss (D= 0.11) at 1 KHz. Simple rectangular antenna prototypes were also designed on substrate samples (C1, C2, P1 and P2). For the antennas (with P2, C1 and C2 as substrates), the bandwidth (BW) is 90 MHz (around 3%). The antenna with P1 substrate presented a surprisingly high BW of 270 MHz that corresponds to a 10% bandwidth. In the microwave range one observes that higher values of the ?r in the range of 3 GHz antennas is also presented by the P1 sample (?r=41.6), and the lowest one was presented by P2 (?r=33.7). Sample P1 also presents the highest value forthe loss (Q-1) which is around 0.1 compared to the other samples which is around 0.03. Therefore, these measurements confirm the potential use for small high (dielectric planar antennas.

                  <td>Since the discovery of colossal dielectric constant in CCTO supercapacitor in 2000, development of its practical application to energy storage has been of great interest. In spite of intensive efforts, there has been thus far, no report of proven application. The object of this research is to understand the reason for this lack of success and to find ways to overcome this limitation. Reported herein is the synthesis of our research in ceramic processing of this material and its characterization, particularly with the objective of identifying potential applications. Experimental results have shown that CCTO's permittivity and loss tangent, the two most essential dielectric parameters of fundamental importance for the efficiency of a capacitor device, are intrinsically coupled. They increase or decrease in tandem. Therefore, efforts to simultaneously retain the high permittivity while minimizing the loss tangent of CCTO might not succeed unless an entirely non-typical approach is taken for processing this material. Based on the experimental results and their analysis, it has been identified that it is possible to produce CCTO bulk ceramics with conventional processes having properties that can be exploited for fabricating an efficient energy storage device (EDS).We have additionally identified that CCTO can be used for the development of efficient solid state capacitors of Class II type comparable to the widely used barium titanate (BT) capacitors. Based on high temperature studies of the resistivity and the Seebeck coefficient it is found that CCTO is a wide bandgap n-type semiconductor material which could be used for high temperature electronics. The temperature dependence of the linear thermal expansion of CCTO shows the presence of possible phase changes at 220 and 770°C the origin of which remains unexplained. © 2013 Author(s).</td>

The X-ray diffraction patterns showed single-phase ceramics with a cubic structure. Increasing sintering times led to substantial improvements in permittivity.

At a firing temperature of 1050°C, an effective permittivity of about ?? = 60 000 and 10 000 was observed for sintered pellets and multilayer laminates, respectively. The typical grain growth observed in pellets is suppressed in multilayer laminates. Impedance spectroscopy was employed to show that the bulk grain resistivity is similar in pellets and multilayer laminates, but the grain-boundary resistivity is higher in pellets. Tapes were processed into multilayer capacitors with Ag/Pd electrodes and cofired at 1050°C. All three types of samples, pellets, laminates, and capacitors were also processed with a glass additive, in which case they can be cofired at a lower temperature of 900°C.

In the frame of the comprehensive model, the Ising-model analysis of dielectric polarization is applied and the energy of the nearest interaction among the dipoles is deduced from the experiments by utilizing the particle swarm optimization. The interaction energy of ?56 meV is reasonably smaller than the experimental value of the thermal activation energy of ?88 meV. The interaction energy is independent of the temperatures, the dipole-chain lengths, and the frequencies of the applied AC electric field.

Although the grounds, contents, and implications of these distinctions differed significantly from author to author, all revolved around a philosophical distinction between “objective” and “subjective” which had emerged ca. 1840. It was this new philosophical distinction which permitted the revisionist probabilists to conceive of the possibility of “objective probabilities,” which would have been an oxymoron for classical probabilists such as Jakob Bernoulli and Pierre Simon Laplace. Without relinquishing the rigid determinism of the classical probabilists, the revisionists were nonetheless able to grant chance an objective status in the world by opposing it to the subjective variability of the mind.</td>

Bees were of particular importance to natural theologians as examples of God’s design in nature. Other naturalists sought to explain their complex behaviour without invoking design, but there was still no agreement on how bees were able to make their cells so perfect. The work of Charles Darwin and William Tegetmeier on this subject sought to settle the controversy; yet their experiments and arguments did not convince everyone in the apiarian world.</td>

                  <td>This paper examines the origin and philosophical significance of Richard Owen's (1804-92) theory of the archetypal vertebrate in relation to the important methodological developments of German-inspired anti-empiricist methodologies in England in the 1814-45 period, particularly as articulated by Samuel Taylor Coleridge and his close disciple, the surgeon Joseph Henry Green (1791-1863), and in a parallel form by William Whewell. Positioned in intimate contact with both Green and Whewell in the crucial 1840s period, Owen was able to develop his theory of the archetype in direct contact with these methodological insights. This warrants the recognition of determinative intellectual and conceptual issues in the formulation of this theory in addition to the social constructivist factors suggested by Nicolaas Rupke and Adrian Desmond. The general conclusion of the paper suggests that both kinds of factor are needed to understand Owen's important theoretical development. © 2003 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.</td>

                  <td>The analogy between artificial selection of domestic varieties and natural selection in nature was a vital element of Darwin's argument in his Origin of Species. Ever since, the image of breeders creating new varieties by artificial selection has served as a convincing illustration of how the theory works. In this paper I argue that we need to reconsider our understanding of Darwin's analogy. Contrary to what is often assumed, nineteenth-century animal breeding practices constituted a highly controversial field that was fraught with difficulties. It was only with considerable effort that Darwin forged his analogy, and he only succeeded by downplaying the importance of two other breeding techniques - crossing of varieties and inbreeding - that many breeders deemed essential to obtain new varieties. Part of the explanation for Darwin's gloss on breeding practices, I shall argue, was that the methods of his main informants, the breeders of fancy pigeons, were not representative of what went on in the breeding world at large. Darwin seems to have been eager to take the pigeon fanciers at their word, however, as it was only their methods that provided him with the perfect analogy with natural selection. Thus while his studies of domestic varieties were important for the development of the concept of natural selection, the reverse was also true: Darwin's comprehension of breeding practices was moulded by his understanding of the working of natural selection in nature. Historical studies of domestic breeding practices in the eighteenth and nineteenth century confirm that, besides selection, the techniques of inbreeding and crossing were much more important than Darwin's interpretation allowed for. And they still are today. This calls for a reconsideration of the pedagogic use of Darwin's analogy too. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.</td>

It is argued that at least some of the features brought to the fore in their treatment of the work of Gregory and Ellis – namely “geometrical methods” in mathematics and “anti-metaphysical”, “non-hypothetical” and “practical” knowledge – cannot be straightforwardly upheld. On the one hand, Gregory’s generalisation of George Peacock’s symbolical algebra was connected to several natural philosophical considerations underlying the Scottish Newtonians’ “abstractionism” and “geometrical fluxional analysis”. On the other hand, Ellis’s idealist philosophy of mathematics and science insisted that the a priori necessary truths of mathematics could inform the “hypothetical part of scientific induction”. A more nuanced understanding of the place of the second generation of reformers within the analytical revolution in Victorian Britain should thus take into account the eclectic foundational position that arises from the work of Gregory and Ellis.</td>

                  <td>Historian Herbert Mehrtens sought to portray the history of turn-of-the-century mathematics as a struggle of modern vs countermodern, led respectively by David Hilbert and Felix Klein. Some of Mehrtens’ conclusions have been picked up by both historians (Jeremy Gray) and mathematicians (Frank Quinn). We argue that Klein and Hilbert, both at Göttingen, were not adversaries but rather modernist allies in a bid to broaden the scope of mathematics beyond a narrow focus on arithmetized analysis as practiced by the Berlin school. Klein’s Göttingen lecture and other texts shed light on Klein’s modernism. Hilbert’s views on intuition are closer to Klein’s views than Mehrtens is willing to allow. Klein and Hilbert were equally interested in the axiomatisation of physics. Among Klein’s credits is helping launch the career of Abraham Fraenkel, and advancing the careers of Sophus Lie, Emmy Noether, and Ernst Zermelo, all four surely of impeccable modernist credentials. Mehrtens’ unsourced claim that Hilbert was interested in production rather than meaning appears to stem from Mehrtens’ marxist leanings. Mehrtens’ claim that [the future SS-Brigadeführer] “Theodor Vahlen . . . cited Klein’s racist distinctions within mathematics, and sharpened them into open antisemitism” fabricates a spurious continuity between the two figures mentioned and is thus an odious misrepresentation of Klein’s position.</td>

                  <td>Background: The four approaches to hysterectomy for benign disease are abdominal hysterectomy (AH), vaginal hysterectomy (VH), laparoscopic hysterectomy (LH) and robotic-assisted hysterectomy (RH). Objectives: To assess the effectiveness and safety of different surgical approaches to hysterectomy for women with benign gynaecological conditions. Search methods: We searched the following databases (from inception to 14 August 2014) using the Ovid platform: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE; EMBASE; Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and PsycINFO. We also searched relevant citation lists. We used both indexed and free-text terms. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which clinical outcomes were compared between one surgical approach to hysterectomy and another. Data collection and analysis: At least two review authors independently selected trials, assessed risk of bias and performed data extraction. Our primary outcomes were return to normal activities, satisfaction, quality of life, intraoperative visceral injury and major long-term complications (i.e. fistula, pelvi-abdominal pain, urinary dysfunction, bowel dysfunction, pelvic floor condition and sexual dysfunction). Main results: We included 47 studies with 5102 women. The evidence for most comparisons was of low or moderate quality. The main limitations were poor reporting and imprecision. Vaginal hysterectomy (VH) versus abdominal hysterectomy (AH) (nine RCTs, 762 women) Return to normal activities was shorter in the VH group (mean difference (MD) -9.5 days, 95% confidence interval (CI) -12.6 to -6.4, three RCTs, 176 women, I2 = 75%, moderate quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between the groups for the other primary outcomes. Laparoscopic hysterectomy (LH) versus AH (25 RCTs, 2983 women) Return to normal activities was shorter in the LH group (MD -13.6 days, 95% CI -15.4 to -11.8; six RCTs, 520 women, I2 = 71%, low quality evidence), but there were more urinary tract injuries in the LH group (odds ratio (OR) 2.4, 95% CI 1.2 to 4.8, 13 RCTs, 2140 women, I2 = 0%, low quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between the groups for the other primary outcomes. LH versus VH (16 RCTs, 1440 women) There was no evidence of a difference between the groups for any primary outcomes. Robotic-assisted hysterectomy (RH) versus LH (two RCTs, 152 women) There was no evidence of a difference between the groups for any primary outcomes. Neither of the studies reported satisfaction rates or quality of life. Overall, the number of adverse events was low in the included studies. Authors' conclusions: Among women undergoing hysterectomy for benign disease, VH appears to be superior to LH and AH, as it is associated with faster return to normal activities. When technically feasible, VH should be performed in preference to AH because of more rapid recovery and fewer febrile episodes postoperatively. Where VH is not possible, LH has some advantages over AH (including more rapid recovery and fewer febrile episodes and wound or abdominal wall infections), but these are offset by a longer operating time. No advantages of LH over VH could be found; LH had a longer operation time, and total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) had more urinary tract injuries. Of the three subcategories of LH, there are more RCT data for laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy and LH than for TLH. Single-port laparoscopic hysterectomy and RH should either be abandoned or further evaluated since there is a lack of evidence of any benefit over conventional LH. Overall, the evidence in this review has to be interpreted with caution as adverse event rates were low, resulting in low power for these comparisons. The surgical approach to hysterectomy should be discussed and decided in the light of the relative benefits and hazards. These benefits and hazards seem to be dependent on surgical expertise and this may influence the decision. In conclusion, when VH is not feasible, LH may avoid the need for AH, but LH is associated with more urinary tract injuries. There is no evidence that RH is of benefit in this population. Preferably, the surgical approach to hysterectomy should be decided by the woman in discussion with her surgeon. © 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration.</td>

Methods: A single-institutional, matched, retrospective, cohort study was performed. Between May 2010 and March 2011, 85 consecutive women were submitted to a total laparoscopic hysterectomy by S-LPS, M-LPS, and single-port LESS. Perioperative outcomes of these three techniques were analyzed and compared. Results: Demographics and baseline characteristics of each group were absolutely comparable. The median operative time was longer [105 (range, 75-125)min] in the LESS group compared with the M-LPS group [90 (range, 60-120) min; p &lt; 0.011] and S-LPS [80 (range, 50-110) min; p &lt; 0.001]. No statistically significant differences have been reported for estimated blood loss or intra- and early postoperative complications. Postoperative pain controlwas better for LESS and M-LPS than S-LPS. Conclusions: M-LPS and LESS hysterectomy can be performed safely, and both seem to be associated with a halving of early postoperative pain with a lower request of analgesics. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.</td>

This study aimed to evaluate our initial experience with S-LAVH compared with the more conventional three-port LAVH in women with benign uterine diseases. Methods: Between April 2009 and April 2010, S-LAVH was attempted on 183 patients with benign uterine diseases through a transumbilical incision for a 12-mm trocar, and conventional LAVH was performed on 275 patients by the same surgeon. The medical records of patients were reviewed. The age, body mass index, operative time, blood loss, and uterine weight on pathologic report were compared. Results: Two of 183 patients in the S-LAVH group were converted to two-or three-port surgery, compared with none in the conventional group. Data analysis was done for 181 patients in the S-LAVH group and 275 patients in the conventional LAVH group. No major complications, including ureteral or bladder injuries, occurred in any of the patients. No statistically significant differences were found in mean age, mean body mass index, mean operative time, mean anesthesia time, mean estimated blood loss, or mean postoperative days to passage of flatus, but the mean uterine weights on the pathologic reports were significantly reduced in the S-LAVH group. Conclusion: S-LAVH could be a feasible alternative method for removal of the uterus with a better cosmetic outcome resulting from single wound in selected patients. For patients with large-sized uterus, more surgical experience and improvement in instruments suitable for S-LAVH are needed. © Copyright 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.</td>

                  <td>Preoperative anaemia is associated with adverse outcomes after cardiac surgery but outcomes after non-cardiac surgery are not well established. We aimed to assess the effect of preoperative anaemia on 30-day postoperative morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing major non-cardiac surgery. We analysed data for patients undergoing major non-cardiac surgery in 2008 from The American College of Surgeons' National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database (a prospective validated outcomes registry from 211 hospitals worldwide in 2008). We obtained anonymised data for 30-day mortality and morbidity (cardiac, respiratory, CNS, urinary tract, wound, sepsis, and venous thromboembolism outcomes), demographics, and preoperative and perioperative risk factors. We used multivariate logistic regression to assess the adjusted and modified (nine predefined risk factor subgroups) effect of anaemia, which was defined as mild (haematocrit concentration &gt;29-&lt;39 in men and &gt;29-&lt;36 in women) or moderate-to-severe (?29 in men and women) on postoperative outcomes. We obtained data for 227 425 patients, of whom 69 229 (30·44) had preoperative anaemia. After adjustment, postoperative mortality at 30 days was higher in patients with anaemia than in those without anaemia (odds ratio [OR] 1·42, 95 CI 1·31-1·54); this difference was consistent in mild anaemia (1·41, 1·30-1·53) and moderate-to-severe anaemia (1·44, 1·29-1·60). Composite postoperative morbidity at 30 days was also higher in patients with anaemia than in those without anaemia (adjusted OR 1·35, 1·30-1·40), again consistent in patients with mild anaemia (1·31, 1·26-1·36) and moderate-to-severe anaemia (1·56, 1·47-1·66). When compared with patients without anaemia or a defined risk factor, patients with anaemia and most risk factors had a higher adjusted OR for 30-day mortality and morbidity than did patients with either anaemia or the risk factor alone. Preoperative anaemia, even to a mild degree, is independently associated with an increased risk of 30-day morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing major non-cardiac surgery.

                  <td>Objective: To examine outcomes in patients who receive small amounts of intraoperative blood transfusion. Design: Longitudinal, uncontrolled observational study evaluating results of intraoperative transfusion in patients entered into the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. We made propensity-matched comparisons between patients who received and did not receive intraoperative transfusion to minimize confounding when estimating the effect of intraoperative transfusion on postoperative outcomes. Setting: We queried the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database for patients undergoing operations between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2009. Patients: A large sample of surgical patients from 173 hospitals throughout the United States. Main Outcome Measures: Operative mortality and serious perioperative morbidity (?1 of 20 complications). Results: After exclusions, 941 496 operations were analyzed in patients from 173 hospitals. Most patients (893 205 patients [94.9%]) did not receive intraoperative transfusions. Patients who received intraoperative infusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells (15 186 patients [1.6%]) had higher unadjusted rates of mortality and more serious morbidity. These rates further increased with intraoperative transfusion of more than 1 unit of packed red blood cells in a dose-dependent manner. After propensity matching to adjust for multiple preoperative risks, transfusion of a single unit of packed red blood cells increased the multivariate risk of mortality, wound problems, pulmonary complications, postoperative renal dysfunction, systemic sepsis, composite morbidity, and postoperative length of stay compared with propensity-matched patients who did not receive intraoperative transfusion. Conclusions: There is a dose-dependent adverse effect of intraoperative blood transfusion. It is likely that a small, possibly discretionary amount of intraoperative transfusion leads to increased mortality, morbidity, and resource use, suggesting that caution should be used with intraoperative transfusions for mildly hypovolemic or anemic patients. ©2012 American Medical Association.

                  <td>Introduction Over the past three decades, rates of overweight and obesity internationally have risen to epidemic proportions. There are currently no published prospective studies examining the effect of obesity on gynaecologic laparoscopy for benign indications within a population with obesity rates comparable to Australian women. Aims To assess and quantify whether increasing patient body mass index negatively impacted upon the ability to successfully complete planned laparoscopic surgery. Methods From January 2009 until October 2012, 307 women undergoing laparoscopic gynaecological surgery for benign pathology were recruited. Intra-operative variables included the following: ease of identification of anatomical landmarks, entry technique and number of attempts, conversion to laparotomy and any complications encountered. Any post-operative complications were recorded at the six week post-operative review. Results 94.46% of operations were completed as planned. As BMI increased, the ease of identification of important anatomical landmarks significantly decreased. There was no correlation between increasing BMI and surgical complication rates. Conclusions Planned gynaecological laparoscopy can be performed in obese patients with a high likelihood of completion. In this study, obesity was not associated with a significant increase in complication rates or failure to complete the surgery as planned. © 2014 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.</td>

                  <td>OBJECTIVES: To estimate the prevalence of urinary tract injury and the relative risk of litigation from an injury for benign gynecologic surgery in Canada and to analyze a subset of cases of litigation, determining independent risk factors that predicted medical and legal outcomes. METHODS: The prevalence of urinary tract injury and the relative risks of litigation from an injury were determined from the national hospital discharge abstract and the national physician malpractice databases. Multiple logistic regression was performed on a subset of litigation cases. RESULTS: The prevalence of urinary tract injury at benign gynecologic surgery was low (0.33%). If a patient sustained a urinary tract injury, there was a high relative risk of litigation (relative risk 91, 95% confidence interval [CI] 55-158). Patients had a higher chance of major disability after urinary tract injury from hysterectomy for abnormal uterine bleeding (odds ratio [OR] 6.16, 95% CI 1.13-39.01, P = .04), but a lower chance of this being a permanent disability (OR 0.23,95% CI 0.05-0.96, P = .05). Permanent disability was more likely after an obstructed ureter compared with other types of urinary tract injuries (OR 4.54, 95% CI 1.55-14.88, P = .008). Only 18% of the injuries were recognized intraoperatively. An acute bladder injury was more likely to be recognized intraoperatively than other types of injury (OR 14.98,95% CI 3.89-57.74, P &lt; .001). No obstructed ureters or urinary tract fistulae were recognized intraoperatively. CONCLUSION: Urinary tract injuries are an uncommon but significant complication from benign gynecologic surgery. Such injuries are associated a high relative risk of litigation. © 2005 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.</td>

Using a prospective study (Canadian Task Force classification II-2) at a dedicated high-volume gynecologic laparoscopy center, a total of 350 women who underwent TLH from January 2005 through January 2007 were assigned into 2 groups. The indications for TLH were predominantly myomas and menorrhagia. In group A, TLH was done by suturing both uterine arteries at the beginning of the procedure. In group B, the uterine arteries were sutured after the cornual pedicles as done conventionally. All the other pedicles were desiccated and cut either with harmonic ultracision or bipolar diathermy. The uterus with cervix was removed either vaginally or by morcellation. The median age of patients in group A was 46 years and in group B was 44 years. Mean uterine size, weight, estimated blood loss, total operating time, need for blood transfusion, and complications were analyzed. In group A the total duration of surgery was 60 minutes (range 20–210). In group B, the total duration of surgery was 70 minutes (range 30–190). In group A, the median total blood loss was 50 mL (range 10–2000). In group B the total blood loss was 60 mL (range 10–2500). The comparison between the 2 groups revealed a statistically significant difference (p &lt;.05, Mann–Whitney test). Need for blood transfusion was less in group A. One patient in group A had secondary hemorrhage 3 weeks later and the vaginal vault was resutured. In group B, 2 patients had blood loss more than 1500 mL (uterus weight &gt; 1000 g) and required 4 units of packed cell transfusion in each. One patient in group B with previous cesarean section had a bladder wall rent and this was sutured laparoscopically using 3-0 delayed absorbable sutures. Uterine artery ligation at the beginning of TLH as done in group A is a technically feasible procedure. It reduces the total blood loss and decreases the time taken for the procedure.</td>
